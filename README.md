# Sign Up Form

First project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Intermediate HTML and CSS Course: a sign-up form for an imaginary service!

We were given a design to follow, and since we were only told to replicate its layout, I decided to replace the placeholder images and text with ones related to the famous manga and anime series *"Hunter x Hunter"*.

This form acts as the one aspiring Hunters would have to fill out before taking the Hunter Exam!
